    <h4><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> Daakye Master Trust Provident Fund Scheme (Tier 3)</h4>
    <p>It is a Tier 3 voluntary pension plan for formal sector workers with contributions up to 16.5% enjoying tax exemptions. This is designed to give workers in both public and private sectors a higher lump sum at retirement. </p>
    <p>Organizations, unions and associations can form their own provident funds under Daakye Master Trust Provident Fund Scheme to enable their staff or members a top up Lump sum at retirement. </p>

      <p>Individuals can also sign on to the provident fund scheme and make contribution towards additional Lump sum at retirement.  </p>
      <p>Unlike Tiers 1&amp;2, the provident fund can be accessed (collect part or full contributions plus interest) before retirement. </p>
